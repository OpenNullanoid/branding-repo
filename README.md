# branding-repo
This repository contains branding files which are used to symbolize OpenNullanoid and would be reused across multiple project repositories and web media.

## Depth Walker
This repository also contains data from the original Depth Walker repository. The Licence for them is actually CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0.

These are kept here for the sake of simplicity but would prefer to move it to somewhere else.

Based on the color scheme: [One Dark(By Robert Luciani - r3tex)](https://github.com/r3tex/one-dark)
